                    <strong>Hi Y'all!</strong> My name is Kevin Fukuhara; I am a native Seattleite born &
                    raised. A bit about myself, I love to watch TV shows and movies on netflix; and if I can't find it...
                    Well there are ways (ARRRRrrr). I also enjoy going to the movies, soemthing about movie theatres is
                    awesome to me. Maybe its all the buttered and salted popcorn I mindlessly devour during the feature film
                    or perhaps the fact that the screen is literally stupid big - mostly because it is an experience I can
                    share with others too I guess. Lastly, my other favorite recreational hobby has to be video games. Ever since I can remember I have been an avid gamer - much happiness and fun has been spent in video games, from solo to co-op to party games alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also like to go outdoors when I have time (and of course when the weather permits) and go for a
                    hike, play pick-up football from this facebook group I joined, and pick-up basketball on Sundays
                    when a group of friends decide to get together. Sometimes I play at LA Fitness, but I left because I
                    didnt use my membership enough lol.
                </p>


                <p>
                    One a more productive note, I am really interested in entrepreneurship. I am excited to join this
                    class so that I can pursue more projects like the one I lead back in college, however this time I
                    would be one of the developers in addition to leading. You've gotten this far without clicking out,
                    so for that, thank you! Hope to meet you soon.
